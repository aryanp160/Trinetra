# 🧠 TRINETRA: AI-Powered Crowd Safety System

**Team ID:** TH0000  
**Team Name:** Simhastha Sect  

---

## 🔍 Overview

**Trinetra** is a full-stack, real-time AI prototype designed to prevent crowd-related tragedies.  
It analyzes live video feeds using an optimized deep learning model to understand complex crowd dynamics.  

The system calculates a multi-factor **Chaos Score** and broadcasts it to a command dashboard. When risk remains high, alerts are dispatched to a dedicated, mobile-first app for on-ground volunteer teams.

---

## 🚨 Problem & Solution

### ❗ Problem

Traditional crowd surveillance is **reactive**. Authorities detect danger only when it’s too late. Simple metrics like crowd density miss the dynamic risks of:

- 🚶‍♂️ **Flow:** Chaotic crowd movement  
- 🚀 **Surge:** Rapid influx of people  

These are **primary triggers** for stampedes.

### ✅ Solution: The Chaos Score

Trinetra calculates a proactive **Chaos Score** based on:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **D (Density)** | How crowded is the space? |
| **F (Flow)**    | How chaotic is the movement? |
| **S (Surge)**   | How rapidly is the crowd growing? |

When the score remains high, Trinetra dispatches alerts to volunteers—**turning AI predictions into real-time action**.

## ⚙️ Logic & Workflow

Trinetra uses a **decoupled, multi-process architecture** to ensure real-time performance:

### 🧪 1. Data Collection (Ingestion)
- Reads frames from a video source (`crowd_video.mp4`)
- Applies pre-checks (blur detection)
- Adds frames to a shared queue

### 🤖 2. AI Processing (Worker Process)
- Pulls frames from queue
- Uses **ONNX Runtime** to analyze crowd
- Calculates D_norm, F_norm, S_norm → Chaos Score
- Passes results to output queue

### 🌐 3. API Server (WebSocket Server)
- Flask-SocketIO server broadcasts data via WebSockets
- Receives dispatch commands from dashboard
- Tracks volunteer status

### 🧑‍💻 4. Admin Dashboard
- React frontend displaying live metrics
- Calculates 10-second average of Chaos Score
- Sends dispatch command when high risk is sustained

### 📱 5. Volunteer App
- Mobile-first React app for on-ground teams
- Displays alerts in real-time with location and score

## 🚀 Setup & Installation Guide

### 🐍 Part 1: Python Backend Setup

1. **Install Anaconda / Miniconda**

2. **Create and activate the environment**

    ```bash
    conda create --name onnx_env python=3.8 -y
    conda activate onnx_env
    ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install onnx onnxruntime opencv-python numpy scipy psutil Flask Flask-Cors Flask-SocketIO python-socketio gevent-websocket waitress
    ```

4. **Export the AI Model (One-Time Step)**

    - Install legacy torch libraries needed for export:

      ```bash
      pip install torch==1.5.0+cpu torchvision==0.6.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
      ```

    - Run the `export_to_onnx.py` script to generate the `p2pnet.onnx` file.
